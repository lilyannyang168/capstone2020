      "Amid all of the kitsch and traffic that is Pigeon Forge stands a boat that looks quite familiar. For what it is, this attraction is very well done. The period costumes of the guides adds to the atmosphere and the "boarding pass" personalizes the experience. It offers a new perspective on the tragedy and we gained some knowledge about this terrible event. If you enjoy history, then bypass the go-karts and head for the ship."
