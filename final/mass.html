        "When I went to the Myrtle Beach location, I really enjoyed it, but I think that was a holiday romance, as the location in Pigeon Forge feels so similar to the one in Myrtle Beach. They have the 360 bikes, the ropes course, the bed of nails, the bubbles exhibit, an arcade, and laser tag, just like the Myrtle Beach location. It's not that it's bad thing mind you, but it was just something that bothered me, given the similarities between the two locations." - <i>Trip Advisor user</i>
